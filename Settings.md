When you first load up SubGadget there will be no settings or setting file.
Once you click OK in the settings menu a settings file will be created in the location specified at the bottom of the settings menu

^Note: Although the screenshot shows C:\SubGadgetSettings, SubGadget will default to the My Documents folder for the Setting file. If you have relocated your My Documents folder to another drive\location you may need to create a folder (or point it to an existing folder) on the C: drive to hold the settings like in the screenshot.

Enabled: If checked SubGadget can be used and will attempt to maintain a connection to the specified server

Bitrate: The tracks will stream at the selected bitrate

Server: Here you can list as many servers as needed by providing a Name, URL (http://server:port), Username, Password, and optionally a Description. If you are using a subsonic.org address and on the same network as the Subsonic server it may be necessary to select the LAN checkbox so it will attempt to use the internal IP of the server to connect.
