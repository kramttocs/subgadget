NOTE: SubGadget will be in MiniMode right after you install the new version. Either undock (Vista) or make it larger (7) to access the main window

## Usage ##
Please see the [userguide](http://code.google.com/p/subgadget/wiki/UserGuide)
  1. Extract file using 7zip
  1. After installing, click on the wrench for the settings menu and enter the address to the subsonic server^, username, and password.
  1. Click Add
  1. Click OK.
  1. The gadget will now notify you if the connection was successful.

  * This needs to be the full address to the server just like you would type in the browser
  * It is recommended to remove the trailing / if one exists although it will work either way
  * HTTPS should work as long as the certificate is valid (this hasn't been thoroughly tested so any feedback on this would be great)
